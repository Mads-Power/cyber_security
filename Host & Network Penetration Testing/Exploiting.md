# Exploitation
- What is exploitation: consists of techniques and tools used by penetration testers/adveseries to gain an initial foothold on a target system or network
- Succesful Exploitation Will heavily depend on the nature and quality of *information gathering* and *service enumeration* performed on the target
## Penetration Testing Phases
1. Information Gathering
2. Enumeration
3. Exploitation
4. Post Exploitation
   1. Privelege Escalation
   2. Maintain Persistant Access
   3. Clearing Tracks
### Banner grabbing and SSH Recon
- Banner grabbing is an information gathering technique used to enumerate information regarding the target operationg system as well as services that are running on its open ports

1. cool nmap banner grapping script: `ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep banner` -> `nmap -sV --script=banner 10.10.x.x` 
2. Netcat: `nc 10.10.x.x 22` <-- port also
3.
